These Mechs have mastered the laws of randomness, and they can always find the most useful weapons from randomness.

[Warning] Please make sure to upgrade MOD [EnvManipulators] to v2.2.3 or later, otherwise there will be code conflicts!

Notes:
1. Just for fun, designed without consideration of game balance.
2. When the game language is not simplified Chinese, the MOD will be displayed in English. 
3. I'm not a native English speaker, and all translations were done with the help of DeepL Translate, so the English text in MOD must be very terrible. If you are interested in helping to optimize the translation, please contact me at Discord or 2994359861@qq.com.

Use:
1. Extract Mod Loader to game directory (https://subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=26&p=117100)
2. Extract MOD to [mods] directory (The path to this file should be [%GAME_DIR%/mods/RndSquad/README.txt])
3. Run game
4. Enable MOD in [Configure Mods]
5. Enable True Random Squad in [Edit Squads]
6. If it does not work, please restart the game
